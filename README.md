#About

Vocamon is a Discord bot that provides users with a virtual pet.

#To-Do:

* flush stdout before restart
* move command groups into separate files?
* stats picture needs to be prettified
* move text output into own module.
* make `.egg throw` a subcommand, instead of as an argument to `.egg`
* keep track of time and lower hunger/happy as necessary
* create currency system and shop
* check yourself before you wreck yourself
